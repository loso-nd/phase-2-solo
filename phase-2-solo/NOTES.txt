    -Settig up:
        - We want to keep our state as simple and shallow as possible. 
        - Concerns 
            (Overall notes, notes that the user is seeing, displaying title, and truncated body, When clicking a note from the sidebar, display its contents in the right panel.)
        - Based on the README.md we know that were are receiving an arr of objects. Our state will take a key called notes assigned to an empty arr, which will represent all of our sushi called from the API. 
        - state defined > fetchNotes() includes setState > lifeCycle invokes fetch on page load
        - fetched notes from server > executed the fetch inside commponentDidMount > passed notes props to <SideBar/>, <NoteList/>, details accessed and defined in <NoteItem/>
        

    - When clicking a note from the sidebar, display its contents in the right panel.
